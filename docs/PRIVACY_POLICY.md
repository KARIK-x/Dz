## Data Collection

### What We Collect

**Minimal Data Approach**: We follow a strict privacy-first policy and collect only what is absolutely necessary for the extension to function:

1. **Anonymous User ID** (Generated Locally)
   - A unique identifier created by hashing your browser's installation ID
   - This ID is generated locally in your browser and cannot be traced back to you
   - Used solely to track your cashback balance and activation history

2. **Product Information** (When You Activate Cashback)
   - Product ID from Daraz
   - Product title and price (for display purposes only)
   - Activation timestamp
   - This data is only collected when you explicitly click "Activate Cashback"

3. **Consent Records** (For Transparency)
   - Timestamps of when you view and accept cashback offers
   - IP address (for fraud prevention)
   - Browser user agent (for compatibility)

### What We Never Share

## Data Storage and Security

1. **Local Storage**: Most data is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's secure storage API
2. **Server Storage**: Minimal data (hashed user ID, activation records, balance) is stored on our secure servers

4. **Retention**: Consent logs are automatically deleted after 12 months
